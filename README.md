A simple web based library app. It includes a display of added books, as well as a pop up form to add books. Users specify the title, author, number of pages, and reading status.

## Goals
The goal of this project was to learn how to use object constructors. 

## What I've learned

- Use of a blocker element when creating a pop up.
- Connecting DOM and library state via indexes assigned at card creation.
- Using the Object constructor method.
